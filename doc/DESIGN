Design Notes for Memopol 2
==========================

Memopol is a web application dedicated to revealing and following political processes. The basic feature
is to provide the public (users) with a view of who their representatives are and what they do; how they vote,
what they say.

Technically the application is broken down in layers:

* database or document store

    SQL and/or NoSQL server(s) hosting content, user information...

* server or backend

    An http REST backend that serves dynamic data in JSON format
    Static files are also served (maybe by a different server, maybe by a cdn)

* client or frontend (multiple)

    The client side, control and view layer. Html/javascript for the web and mobile web.
