-- DBXML steps --
This should not be needed for most people (just use the cached dumps), but just in case

- Get and compile dbxml from oracle (./build_all.sh)

- Get dumps from http://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/Memoire_politique_infrastructure_informatique

- Load them into fresh dbxml containers:
  dbxml_load -h . -f meps.dump meps.dbxml
